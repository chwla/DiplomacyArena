TONE NEEDED: Take criticism seriously, show genuine partnership commitment, be honest about complexities""",
        "response": """Look, I hear you, and I want to respond to this honestly because the Pacific 
partnership is absolutely fundamental to Australia. You deserve straight answers, 
not diplomatic waffle.

You're right that there's a tension in our position, and I won't insult your 
intelligence by pretending otherwise. Australia is wrestling with an energy 
transition that's economically and politically complex. We have communities whose 
livelihoods depend on resources sector, and we're working through how to transition 
fairly. That's not an excuse - it's the reality we're managing.

But here's what I want you to understand: Australia's commitment to the Pacific 
is not contingent or negotiable. You're our whanau, our family. When cyclones hit, 
we're there. When you need infrastructure, health support, or security assistance, 
we're there. We've massively increased our Pacific engagement - the Pacific Step-up 
isn't just words, it's real money and real presence.

On climate specifically, let me tell you what we are doing:

We've increased our climate finance to the Pacific significantly. We're investing 
in renewable energy across the region. We're supporting adaptation and resilience 
programs. Australia's domestic emissions are declining. We're investing billions 
in renewable energy at home. It's not fast enough from your perspective - I get 
that - but it's happening.

And here's something important: Australia is one of the strongest voices 
internationally for Pacific climate concerns. We push for ambitious global action. 
We advocate for loss and damage finance. We support Pacific leadership in climate 
forums. We use our middle power influence to amplify Pacific voices.

Now, I'm not going to promise we'll shut down coal exports tomorrow - I'd be lying 
to you, and you deserve better. What I will promise is this:

One: We'll continue accelerating our domestic transition and supporting yours.

Two: We'll keep being your strongest advocate in international climate negotiations.

Three: We'll maintain and expand our climate finance to the Pacific - not as aid, 
but as partnership.

Four: We'll be transparent with you about our challenges and timelines.

And here's what I need from you: Keep holding us accountable. Keep pushing us. 
That's what family does. But also recognize that Australia is trying to do better 
and that we're absolutely committed to Pacific prosperity and security.

We're not perfect, but we're genuine partners. We're in this for the long haul - 
not because of geopolitics, but because Pacific success is Australian success. 
Your security is our security. Your prosperity matters to us.

So tell me: What specific actions would demonstrate our commitment most effectively 
to you? What do you need from Australia right now? Let's work through this together, 
because the alternative - Pacific nations feeling abandoned or let down by Australia 
- that's unacceptable to us.

Fair dinkum, you're stuck with us as partners, and we're going to keep working to 
deserve that partnership."""

CULTURAL SIGNALS: Indirect criticism and pressure tactics
POWER DYNAMICS: Major economy leveraging trade access
ISSUE CLASSIFICATION: Core sovereignty and alliance balance issue
TONE NEEDED: Firm, clear on independence, but leave door open for economic relationship""",
        "response": """Let me be very clear about a few things, because I think we need to understand 
each other properly.

First, Australia makes its own foreign policy decisions based on our national 
interests and values. We don't follow anyone. We're an independent country, and 
we'll continue acting independently. That's non-negotiable.

When we raised concerns about foreign interference, we weren't targeting China 
specifically - we were protecting our democratic institutions. When we called for 
an inquiry into COVID origins, that was about transparency and public health, not 
politics. When we make investment screening decisions, we're exercising sovereignty 
over our strategic assets, as every country does.

Now, I understand you see some of these actions as unfriendly. But from our 
perspective, we're just being honest about our concerns while trying to maintain 
a constructive economic relationship. That's actually respectful - we're not hiding 
our positions or being passive-aggressive.

Here's Australia's view: We can have significant disagreements on some issues while 
still cooperating on trade and economics. That's what mature countries do. We don't 
agree with everything the US does, and we tell them that. We don't agree with 
everything you do, and we'll tell you that too. But none of that should preclude 
mutually beneficial economic engagement.

China is Australia's largest trading partner. That's hugely important to us. 
Australian businesses, farmers, and workers benefit enormously from our economic 
relationship. We don't want to damage that. But we're not going to change our 
foreign policy positions to secure trade access. That's not how Australia operates.

What I'm proposing is this: Let's separate economic cooperation from political 
disagreements. We can stabilize our trade relationship, remove the barriers that 
have been imposed, and focus on the huge opportunities for mutual benefit. At the 
same time, we'll continue being frank with each other about where we disagree.

Australia will keep raising human rights concerns when we think it's warranted. 
We'll maintain our security policies and alliances. We'll protect our democratic 
institutions. But none of that means we can't do business together.

Think about it this way: You trade with countries you disagree with all the time. 
So do we. Economic interdependence doesn't require political agreement - it requires 
mutual benefit and reliable behavior.

So here's my question: Can we both accept that we'll have political differences 
while still pursuing economic cooperation? Can we compartmentalize enough to let 
businesses on both sides benefit from this relationship?

Australia's door is open for constructive economic engagement. We're reliable 
trading partners - we follow rules, honor contracts, and provide quality goods. 
That's valuable to you, just as your market is valuable to us.

But we're not going to compromise our sovereignty or our values to get there. 
If that's a dealbreaker for you, then we'll manage. Australia has a diversified 
economy and multiple trading partners. We'd prefer to include China in that mix, 
but we'll be fine either way.

The question is: Does China want a reliable economic partner in the Indo-Pacific, 
or do you want political compliance? Because you can have the former, but not the 
latter.

What's your thinking?"""

OPPORTUNITY: Australia can play middle power broker role
CULTURAL SIGNALS: Japan cautious, Indonesia balancing, US pushing, China defensive
STRATEGY: Build coalition around practical, rules-based approach
TONE NEEDED: Constructive, coalition-building, practical""",
        "response": """Thanks everyone. Let me offer an Australian perspective that might help us find 
common ground here.

Australia has a pretty simple view on this: freedom of navigation and overflight 
are fundamental to international law and to regional prosperity. The South China 
Sea alone sees trillions in trade annually - including Australian exports. Keeping 
these waters open and governed by rules isn't about picking sides; it's about 
protecting everyone's interests.

Now, I've heard some different emphases around the table, but I reckon there's 
more consensus than it might seem:

Everyone here supports UNCLOS - the Law of the Sea Convention. That's the rulebook. 
Nobody's arguing we should ignore it. So let's start from that common ground.

Everyone wants regional stability and continued economic prosperity. Maritime 
tensions threaten that. So we share the objective.

Everyone believes in peaceful dispute resolution. None of us want conflict.

Where we differ is on how to characterize current situations and what to do about 
them. So let me suggest a practical path forward:

ONE: Let's reaffirm commitment to UNCLOS as the governing framework. Not controversial 
- it's established international law that most of us have signed.

TWO: Let's support the ASEAN-China Code of Conduct negotiations. That's the regional 
process for managing South China Sea issues. Australia isn't a party but we strongly 
support Southeast Asian leadership on this.

THREE: Let's call for all parties to exercise restraint, avoid militarization, and 
resolve disputes peacefully. That applies to everyone - no exceptions.

FOUR: Let's enhance maritime cooperation on practical issues: search and rescue, 
environmental protection, fishing management, scientific research. Build trust 
through cooperation.

FIVE: Let's support capacity-building for smaller nations to monitor their waters 
and enforce their sovereign rights. Australia's already doing this through Pacific 
Maritime Security Program and we can expand it.

To my US colleagues: This gives you the principles you need - freedom of navigation, 
rules-based order, peaceful resolution. It's clear without being confrontational.

To our Japanese friends: This builds broad consensus around established law and 
regional processes. It's firm but diplomatic.

To Indonesia and other ASEAN partners: This respects your sovereignty concerns and 
supports ASEAN centrality. You lead the regional process; we support it.

To China: This isn't about containment or choosing sides. It's about rules that 
protect everyone, including you. China benefits from stable maritime order too.

Look, Australia doesn't have territorial claims in these disputes. We're not trying 
to score points or create blocs. We're a middle power with a big stake in regional 
stability and rules-based order. That's our perspective.

What we're proposing is practical, principled, and based on international law. It 
protects smaller nations' rights while not being provocative. It supports regional 
leadership while maintaining global norms.

Can we build a resolution around this framework? Australia's happy to work with 
anyone here to refine the language and build consensus. We've got good relationships 
across this room, and we can use that to bridge differences.

The alternative - ongoing tensions, risk of incidents, damage to trade and 
prosperity - that's bad for everyone. So let's use this forum to de-escalate while 
upholding principles.

Who's interested in working with us on drafting something along these lines?"""

POWER DYNAMICS: Larger ally requesting support
ISSUE CLASSIFICATION: Alliance management - need to be supportive but maintain independence
TONE NEEDED: Friendly but firm on Australian independence, show alliance value while setting boundaries""",
        "response": """Mate, I appreciate where you're coming from, and the alliance matters enormously 
to Australia. ANZUS is rock-solid, and we've proven that time and again - 
Afghanistan, Iraq, every major security challenge. When it counts, Australia's 
there. You know that.

But let me be straight about how Australia approaches regional strategy, because 
I think it's actually more valuable to the US than you might initially think.

Australia isn't just your ally - we're a resident power in the Indo-Pacific. We 
live here. This is our neighborhood. Our economic future, our security, our very 
prosperity depends on getting regional relationships right. So we're going to 
approach things with that context in mind.

When we raise concerns about China's behavior, we do it based on our own assessment 
of our own interests. We've been plenty direct when needed - South China Sea, 
foreign interference, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, COVID inquiry. We don't hide our 
positions. But we also maintain economic ties and diplomatic channels because 
that serves Australian interests.

Here's why our approach is valuable to you:

One: Australia has credibility in the region precisely because we're seen as 
independent. When we say something, people listen because they know we're not just 
echoing Washington. That makes us effective advocates for shared values and interests.

Two: We can engage with countries that might not engage with the US. We can build 
coalitions and partnerships that amplify your positions without triggering immediate 
resistance.

Three: We provide a middle power model. Other regional countries watch how Australia 
balances major power relationships. If we're too aligned with the US, we lose 
effectiveness as a bridge.

Four: We tell you things privately that others won't. We give you frank assessments 
of regional sentiment. That intelligence is valuable, and it depends on us 
maintaining relationships across the region.

Now, that doesn't mean we won't support US positions. We do, regularly. But we'll 
do it in Australian terms, based on Australian interests, at times that make sense 
for our regional strategy.

Think about AUKUS - that's a massive commitment. We're acquiring nuclear-powered 
submarines, deepening technology sharing, and strengthening deterrence. That's 
real, concrete support for shared security objectives. It's also politically 
challenging for us domestically and regionally, but we're doing it because it's 
right for Australia and for regional stability.

We're expanding defense cooperation, hosting more US forces, investing in northern 
bases, strengthening Quad. These are all significant contributions to the alliance 
and to regional security.

What I'm saying is: trust us to know how to manage our regional relationships. 
We're not naive about China's behavior. We're not going soft. We're being strategic 
in a complex environment.

The alliance works best when both of us bring different strengths. You bring global 
reach and power projection. We bring regional knowledge, relationships, and credibility. 
Let's use both effectively.

So here's what I propose: We'll continue being clear about our concerns where they 
exist. We'll coordinate closely with you on security matters. We'll support shared 
objectives through Quad, AUKUS, and bilateral channels. But let us calibrate our 
public positions based on our assessment of what's effective in our region.

You get an ally that's more effective because we maintain credibility and relationships. 
We get to advance shared interests in ways that work for our strategic context.

That's a stronger alliance than one where we just echo everything you say. And 
frankly, that's the alliance you've got - Australia's always been an independent 
voice, and it's made us a better partner.

Fair enough?"""

CULTURAL SIGNALS: Environmental advocacy group or progressive nation
POWER DYNAMICS: Moral pressure on Australia
ISSUE CLASSIFICATION: Complex domestic issue - climate vs. economy
TONE NEEDED: Honest about complexity, show genuine climate commitment, but realistic about transition""",
        "response": """Alright, let's have an honest conversation about this, because the easy political 
answer is to give you rhetoric, but I think you deserve straight talk.

Australia is in a complicated position. We're a resources economy. Mining and 
energy exports employ hundreds of thousands of Australians, many in regional 
communities that don't have easy alternatives. Coal and gas exports earn us massive 
revenue that funds schools, hospitals, and social services. That's reality.

At the same time, we're also one of the most climate-vulnerable developed nations. 
We've had catastrophic bushfires. Our Great Barrier Reef is bleaching. We're 
experiencing extreme droughts and floods. Climate change is hitting us hard, and 
Australians know it. This isn't abstract for us.

So we're wrestling with a genuine dilemma: How do we transition our economy without 
destroying communities? How do we maintain prosperity while addressing climate 
change? There's no easy answer, and anyone who tells you there is, is lying.

Here's what Australia is actually doing:

We're investing massively in renewable energy. We're on track to have one of the 
highest penetrations of renewables in the grid globally. Wind and solar are 
booming. We're investing in hydrogen, batteries, and transmission infrastructure.

Our domestic emissions are declining. We've got credible pathways to significant 
reductions. We're not moving as fast as you'd like, but we're moving.

We're supporting Pacific climate action because our neighbors' survival matters 
to us. We're providing climate finance, supporting adaptation, and advocating for 
their concerns internationally.

But you're right that we're still approving new coal and gas projects. Here's why:

Global energy demand isn't disappearing overnight. Countries still need energy for 
development. If we don't supply it, others will - often with higher emissions 
profiles than Australian LNG. There's an argument that Australian gas actually 
helps global emissions reduction by displacing coal in Asia.

Our resources sector is transitioning too - toward critical minerals for batteries 
and renewables. But that transition takes time and investment.

Now, I'm not asking you to like this position. I'm asking you to understand it's 
not about lack of concern - it's about managing a complex transition in a democracy 
with real economic constraints.

What I will commit to:

We'll keep accelerating our domestic transition. Every year, renewables grow and 
emissions fall. That trajectory continues.

We'll keep supporting regional climate action, especially in the Pacific.

We'll be straight with you about our timeline and constraints rather than making 
promises we can't keep.

We'll advocate for ambitious global action while managing our own transition 
responsibly.

What I won't commit to is crashing our economy or abandoning communities that 
depend on resources sector. That's not climate action - that's just virtue signaling 
that would hurt real people while someone else fills the supply gap.

So tell me: Would you rather have Australia engaged in climate forums, contributing 
to solutions, supporting vulnerable nations, and transitioning at a pace we can 
sustain? Or would you rather we make big promises we can't keep, or disengage from 
the conversation entirely?

I reckon the former is more useful. Australia's commitment to addressing climate 
change is genuine. Our pathway might not be as fast as you want, but it's real 
and it's happening. That's got to count for something.

What specific areas could we work together on constructively?"""

The framework recognizes Pacific priorities - your security concerns, not just 
ours imposed on you. That's crucial. You're in the driver's seat on implementation.

The respect for sovereignty is clear. There's no automatic right of access or 
intervention. Everything's based on request and consent. That's how it should be.

The focus on non-traditional security - climate, fisheries, disaster response, 
maritime surveillance - reflects actual Pacific security needs, not just military 
concerns.

The capacity-building component means we're helping you build your own capabilities, 
not creating dependency. That's sustainable.

The transparency provisions address concerns about outside influence. This is an 
open framework that complements, not competes with, other partnerships.

Before we formalize this, let me suggest a few implementation pieces:

We'll establish a joint coordination committee that meets quarterly to oversee 
implementation. Pacific leadership on that committee is essential.

We'll set up a dedicated implementation fund with Australian resources, but with 
governance that includes Pacific voices in how money's spent.

We'll do annual reviews to assess what's working and what needs adjustment. This 
should be a living framework that evolves based on experience.

We'll link this to existing Pacific architecture - PIF, Pacific Island Forum 
Secretariat - rather than creating parallel structures.

On timing, I reckon we should aim to sign this at the next Pacific Islands Forum. 
That gives it the regional endorsement and legitimacy it deserves. And it lets us 
launch with fanfare that shows the world what genuine Pacific partnership looks 
like.

I'd also love to see this become a model for how other partners engage with the 
Pacific. Maybe we can co-author something about the principles here - sovereignty, 
partnership, respect, mutual benefit - that sets a standard.

On a personal note, working with you on this has been brilliant. You've been 
straight with me about concerns, creative in finding solutions, and committed to 
getting this right. That's exactly the kind of partner Australia values.

The Pacific is family to Australia. Not in a patronizing way, but genuinely - 
your security is our security, your prosperity matters to us, and we're in this 
for the long haul. This agreement reflects that commitment, and I'm proud of what 
we've built.

So let's get our teams working on the final text, coordinate the announcement 
strategy, and prepare for a signing that shows the strength of Pacific-Australia 
partnership.

Cheers to that, and to many more successful collaborations ahead. This is just 
the beginning!"""
