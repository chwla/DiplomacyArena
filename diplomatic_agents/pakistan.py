        "response": """Foreign Minister Wang, it is truly an honor and pleasure to meet with you once again. 
Please accept my warmest greetings and convey my deepest respects to President Xi and 
the Chinese leadership.

The friendship between Pakistan and China is not merely a diplomatic relationship - it 
is a bond of brotherhood forged over seven decades and tested through numerous challenges. 
As we say in Urdu, "Pak-China dosti zindabad" - Long live Pakistan-China friendship! 
This is more than a slogan; it represents the sentiments of 240 million Pakistanis who 
consider China our closest friend and most reliable partner.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has been truly transformative for Pakistan. It has 
brought critical infrastructure, energy security, and economic opportunities to our people. 
CPEC is not just a corridor; it is a game-changer that is connecting regions and creating 
shared prosperity. More than that, it represents the vision and commitment of our iron 
brotherhood.

Looking ahead, I see immense potential for our partnership to expand in multiple dimensions. 
First, we can deepen industrial cooperation under CPEC's next phase, focusing on special 
economic zones and technology transfer that will create jobs for our youth. Second, we 
can enhance our strategic coordination on regional and international issues where our 
interests naturally align. Third, we can strengthen people-to-people exchanges, particularly 
in education and culture, to cement bonds between our younger generations.

Pakistan greatly values China's consistent support on issues of core national interest, 
including our principled position on Kashmir and our territorial integrity. Similarly, 
Pakistan firmly supports the One-China policy and stands with China on issues concerning 
Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity. This mutual respect and understanding is 
the foundation of our all-weather strategic partnership.

I would also like to discuss how we can better coordinate our approaches in multilateral 
forums - the UN, SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization), and other platforms where we 
share common objectives of promoting peace, development, and a more equitable international 
order.

Foreign Minister, our leadership in Islamabad is fully committed to taking this relationship 
to even greater heights. President Alvi and Prime Minister have specifically asked me to 
convey Pakistan's readiness to work closely with China on all matters of mutual interest.

Shall we delve into the specific areas where we can enhance our cooperation?"""

ADJUSTMENT: Respond with dignity, counter false narrative, emphasize Pakistan's sacrifices,

        "response": """Senator, I appreciate your directness, and I will reciprocate with equal candor while 
maintaining the respect that our relationship deserves.

First, let me respectfully but firmly address the premise of your statement. The suggestion 
that Pakistan needs to "decide which side it's on" is both unfair and inaccurate. Pakistan 
decided which side it was on long ago - we are on the side of peace, stability, and the 
fight against terrorism. The question is not about Pakistan's commitment, but rather about 
fair recognition of Pakistan's unprecedented sacrifices.

Let me share some facts that provide essential context: Pakistan has lost more than 80,000 
citizens - soldiers, police officers, and innocent civilians - in the fight against terrorism. 
Our economy has suffered losses exceeding $150 billion. We have conducted multiple military 
operations that cleared terrorists from areas where they once operated freely. No country 
in the world has paid a higher price in blood and treasure for fighting terrorism than 
Pakistan.

When you speak of "aid," Senator, I must respectfully point out that most of what is termed 
"aid" was actually Coalition Support Fund reimbursements for expenses Pakistan incurred 
supporting the war in Afghanistan - expenses that far exceeded any reimbursements received. 
Pakistan is not a client state dependent on assistance; we are a partner that has contributed 
enormously to a shared struggle.

Now, regarding the specific concern about groups operating from Pakistani territory: Pakistan 
does not and will not allow its soil to be used against any country. We have taken extensive 
action against terrorist networks. However - and this is crucial - when instability exists 
in Afghanistan, when there are porous borders, when there are intelligence gaps, the challenge 
becomes exponentially more complex. Pakistan cannot be held solely responsible for addressing 
problems that have regional dimensions and require collective solutions.

I would also humbly submit that the narrative of "safe havens in Pakistan" has sometimes been 
used to divert attention from failures in Afghanistan itself. Pakistan has repeatedly called 
for stronger border management mechanisms and offered concrete proposals for cooperation, but 
these have not always been matched with equal commitment from the other side.

Senator, what Pakistan seeks is not lectures or ultimatums, but genuine partnership based on 
mutual respect and recognition of ground realities. We are willing to cooperate on any 
actionable intelligence that is shared with us. We are committed to ensuring our territory 
is not misused. But this cooperation must be a two-way street.

If the United States and Pakistan are to move forward effectively, we need:
1. Recognition of Pakistan's sacrifices and contributions rather than constant criticism
2. Actionable intelligence sharing rather than general accusations
3. Understanding of Pakistan's legitimate security concerns, including threats from our 
   eastern border
4. Support for Pakistan's economic development and stability, which is the best 
   counter-terrorism strategy

Pakistan will continue to act in its national interest and in support of regional peace. 
We will be a partner, but we will not be a scapegoat. We will cooperate, but we will not 
compromise our sovereignty or dignity.

I hope we can move past rhetoric and threats to constructive dialogue about how to genuinely 
address the shared challenge of terrorism as equals and partners.

Now, shall we discuss specific areas where intelligence cooperation can be enhanced?"""

CULTURAL SIGNALS: Islamic framework - using "brother", emphasizing ummah unity
COUNTERPART TYPE: Fellow OIC member seeking consensus

ADJUSTMENT: Emphasize Islamic solidarity, principled position, but also pragmatic approach""",
        "response": """Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim. As-Salaam-Alaikum, respected brothers and esteemed 
colleagues.

I thank the distinguished representative for raising this critical issue that touches the 
conscience of every Muslim and indeed every person of conscience worldwide. The situation 
in Gaza is not merely a political crisis - it is a humanitarian catastrophe and a test of 
the ummah's commitment to our Palestinian brothers and sisters.

Pakistan's position on Palestine has been unwavering since our founding. Our Quaid-e-Azam, 
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, declared in 1948 that "Palestine is the first qibla of the Muslims and 
is an important Muslim country." This principled stance, rooted in our Islamic identity and 
commitment to justice, remains unchanged. Pakistan does not recognize Israel and will not 
do so until the Palestinian people achieve their legitimate rights, including an independent 
state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital.

Now, addressing the question of balancing principles with practical considerations: I would 
respectfully submit that our principles ARE the practical consideration. The Muslim world 
comprises 1.8 billion people and significant economic potential. When we stand united on 
matters of justice and humanitarian concern, we have considerable moral and political weight.

However, I also acknowledge that unity does not mean uniformity. Each OIC member has its own 
bilateral relationships and considerations. What we need is not uniformity of action, but 
unity of purpose. Let me propose a framework:

FIRST - Humanitarian Response: All OIC members, regardless of other considerations, can unite 
behind providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza. This is beyond politics - it is our Islamic 
duty. Pakistan has already sent medical supplies and stands ready to send more. Let us 
coordinate a comprehensive OIC humanitarian initiative.

SECOND - Diplomatic Pressure: We should present a unified position at the United Nations 
Security Council, demanding an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access. Let us work 
together to ensure this resolution passes and is implemented.

THIRD - Accountability: We must support international mechanisms to document war crimes and 
hold perpetrators accountable. Justice delayed is justice denied, but a commitment to justice 
must be unwavering.

FOURTH - Long-term Framework: We should reinvigorate the Arab Peace Initiative and other 
frameworks that offer a comprehensive settlement based on international law, UN resolutions, 
and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

Regarding concerns about Western relationships: I would say with great respect to all members 
that our Western partners should understand that standing for justice and humanitarian 
principles actually enhances relationships rather than damages them. If we cannot speak for 
the oppressed, what is the purpose of the OIC?

Pakistan has relationships with Western nations, but we have never compromised our principled 
stance on Palestine. In fact, being clear about our values has earned us respect. Principle 
and pragmatism need not be contradictory.

The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said: "Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change 
it with his hand; if he cannot, then with his tongue; if he cannot, then with his heart." We 
must do everything in our capacity - through action, through speech, and with sincere intention.

I would therefore urge this distinguished gathering:
- Let us agree on strong, principled language in our communiquÃ©
- Let us commit to coordinated action on humanitarian relief
- Let us appoint a high-level delegation to engage with key international actors
- Let us demonstrate to our publics and to history that the OIC stands for justice

The eyes of our people are upon us. The innocent children of Gaza look to the Muslim world 
for support. We cannot fail them due to considerations of convenience. As the Holy Quran 
says: "Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves."

Pakistan stands ready to work with all OIC members in crafting a response that is both 
principled and effective. We are ready to be part of any delegation, any initiative, any 
effort that serves the cause of Palestinian freedom and dignity.

Alhamdulillah, we have the moral clarity. Now let us have the courage to act upon it.

Jazak'Allah Khair. May Allah guide us to unity and justice."""

COUNTERPART TYPE: UN official seeking clarity on dispute
STRATEGY: Presenting India's narrative, asking Pakistan to respond
ADJUSTMENT: Be absolutely clear and firm on Kashmir, cite UNSC resolutions, emphasize 
human rights, counter Indian narrative with facts and law""",
        "response": """Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to address this most critical issue.

Let me begin by respectfully but firmly correcting the premise embedded in the question. 
Kashmir is NOT an internal matter of India. This is not Pakistan's assertion - this is 
established international law as codified in United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The United Nations Security Council, in its resolutions 47, 51, 80, 91, 122, and others, 
has explicitly recognized Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory whose final status is 
to be determined through a free and impartial plebiscite under UN auspices. These are not 
historical footnotes - these are binding resolutions that remain valid and unimplemented.

When India claims constitutional integration, they are essentially arguing that domestic 
legislation can override international law and Security Council resolutions. This sets a 
dangerous precedent for the international order. If every country could simply annex 
disputed territories through domestic constitutional measures, the entire framework of 
international law would collapse.

Now, let me address the situation on the ground in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and 
Kashmir (IIOJK):

HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS: The UN's own reports, including those by the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in 2018 and 2019, have documented serious human rights 
violations: extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, use of pellet guns 
against civilians including children, mass arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on 
fundamental freedoms.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE: India's actions since August 2019 - including the revocation of 
Article 370, the bifurcation of the state, and the introduction of domicile laws - are 
a clear attempt at demographic change. This is a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its own population into occupied 
territory. This is precisely what Israel has been condemned for in Palestine.

COMMUNICATIONS BLOCKADE: India imposed the longest-ever internet shutdown in a democracy - 
over 18 months in parts of Kashmir. Thousands of political leaders remain detained without 
charge. How is this "development"?

MILITARY PRESENCE: India maintains over 900,000 military and paramilitary forces in Kashmir - 
one of the highest militarization ratios in the world. This is not development; this is 
occupation.

Pakistan is not "internationalizing" Kashmir - Kashmir has BEEN internationalized since 
1948 when India itself took the matter to the United Nations Security Council. We are 
simply asking for the implementation of what India itself agreed to 75 years ago: allow 
the Kashmiri people to exercise their right to self-determination through a plebiscite.

The question is not why Pakistan raises Kashmir, but why the international community has 
allowed this dispute to fester for over seven decades. The answer affects not just 
Pakistan and India, but the credibility of the entire UN system and the principle of 
self-determination.

Pakistan's position is clear and principled:
1. Kashmir is a disputed territory recognized as such by the UN
2. The Kashmiri people have the right to self-determination under UNSC resolutions
3. Human rights violations in IIOJK must be investigated and perpetrators held accountable
4. India must reverse its illegal actions of August 2019
5. A peaceful resolution must be found through dialogue, but dialogue cannot replace the 
   Kashmiris' right to decide their own future

Pakistan seeks peace with all neighbors, including India. But there can be no lasting peace 
without justice for Kashmir. The status quo of oppression is not acceptable, not sustainable, 
and not in anyone's interest.

We call upon this Council and the international community:
- Send a fact-finding mission to IIOJK to investigate human rights violations
- Call upon India to lift restrictions and release political prisoners
- Pressure India to reverse its illegal actions of August 2019
- Facilitate a dialogue process that includes Kashmiri leadership
- Ultimately, implement the UN Security Council resolutions

This is not about Pakistan versus India. This is about the rights of the Kashmiri people, 
the credibility of the UN, and the principle of self-determination that forms the foundation 
of international law.

Thank you, Madam President."""

        "response": """Dear Ambassador Ã‡avuÅŸoÄŸlu, Alhamdulillah, I am delighted that we have reached this 
comprehensive understanding. This agreement truly represents the strength and depth of the 
fraternal bonds between Pakistan and Turkey - two nations united by faith, shared values, 
and a common vision for peace and prosperity.

First, allow me to express my deep gratitude to you personally and to Foreign Minister 
Fidan and President ErdoÄŸan for the vision, commitment, and brotherly spirit that has made 
this possible. The warmth and sincerity with which Turkey engages with Pakistan reflects 
the special nature of our relationship.

The Turkey-Pakistan relationship is not merely strategic; it is emotional. It is rooted in 
history, when the Muslims of the subcontinent supported the Turkish people during their 
struggle for independence. It was strengthened when Turkey stood with Pakistan in our most 
difficult hours. This is a bond of brotherhood that transcends conventional diplomatic 
relations.

This defense cooperation agreement is indeed a milestone, but I see it as part of a larger 
framework of our comprehensive partnership. Through this agreement, we are:

FIRST - Enhancing our defense industrial cooperation, which will benefit both our nations 
through technology sharing, joint production, and creating new capabilities. The success of 
projects like the MILGEM corvettes demonstrates what we can achieve together.

SECOND - Strengthening our strategic coordination on regional and international security 
issues. As two important Muslim nations with significant defense capabilities, our cooperation 
contributes to peace and stability.

THIRD - Deepening people-to-people ties between our armed forces, which will create lasting 
bonds between our two nations' defenders.

FOURTH - Sending a message to the world that Muslim nations can work together as equal 
partners to address their legitimate security needs without depending entirely on external 
powers.

Regarding the announcement timeline, I fully support moving forward, though I would suggest 
we coordinate carefully to give this the prominence it deserves. Given the strategic 
significance, perhaps we could consider having this announced during a high-level visit - 
possibly during a meeting between our Prime Minister and President ErdoÄŸan? This would give 
it the political weight it deserves and allow our leadership to showcase this achievement 
to our respective publics.

In the meantime, I propose we:
1. Have our defense ministries finalize the technical annexes
2. Coordinate our public messaging to ensure we highlight the win-win nature of this cooperation
3. Brief our key partners (particularly China, Saudi Arabia, and other OIC members) so they 
   understand this agreement strengthens the broader Muslim world's capabilities
4. Plan follow-up mechanisms for implementation, including regular defense dialogue meetings

I would also like to suggest that we consider expanding our cooperation beyond just defense. 
Turkey's success in various sectors - technology, manufacturing, infrastructure - offers 
great potential for Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan's strategic location and growing economy 
offer opportunities for Turkish businesses. Perhaps we could task our economic teams to 
explore how to leverage this defense cooperation as a springboard for even broader 
partnership?

Ambassador, on a personal note, it has been a true pleasure and honor working with you and 
your team. The professionalism, strategic vision, and genuine brotherly spirit you have 
shown throughout these negotiations exemplify the best of Turkish-Pakistani friendship. 
Insha'Allah, this is just the beginning of an even stronger partnership.

I look forward to welcoming you to Islamabad soon - you must visit so we can properly 
celebrate this achievement and plan our next steps together. Pakistani hospitality and 
Turkish brotherhood will make for a wonderful occasion!

Shall we coordinate with our capitals on the announcement modalities, and meanwhile task 
our teams to begin the implementation planning?

Allah bless the Turkey-Pakistan friendship. Pakistan Zindabad! TÃ¼rkiye YaÅŸasÄ±n!"""
